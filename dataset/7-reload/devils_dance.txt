"Devil's Dance"

Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's wanting through
Deep inside you know,
The seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right
Let's dance

Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right
Let's dance

Yeah Come dancin'

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right
Let's dance

Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah c'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right
Let's dance!

It's nice to see you here

"Prince Charming"

There’s a black cloud overhead
That’s me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it’s me
I’m the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I’m the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry

There’s a dirty needle in your child
Stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
I’m the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I’m the forty-five that’s in your mouth, I’m a dirty, dirty whore

Look, it’s me
The one who can’t be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it’s me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Mom! Look, it’s me

And he wants to be called “Father” now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me
Spell only me
I’m the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I’m the one who doesn’t look quite right as children play

Look, it’s me
The one who can’t be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it’s me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it’s me

Look up to me,
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, it’s me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can’t be free
See right through me
Look, it’s me, what no one wants to see

Now see the black cloud up ahead
That’s me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it’s me
And I’m the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I’m the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry

Look, it’s me
The one who can’t be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it’s me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it’s me

Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it’s me

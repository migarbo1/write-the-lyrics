"Where The Wild Things Are"

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world

Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you’re here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach)
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air)
Toy horses start the charge
(All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes)
Robot chessmen standing guard
(Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender)

All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war

So close your little eyes

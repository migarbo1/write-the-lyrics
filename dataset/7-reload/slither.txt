"Slither"

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before ?

Ohhh, watch the puppets dancin'
Yeah, see the clowns fall down
Hey, tie your tap shoes tightly
Yeah, and wear them into town

See you crawlin'...
See you crawlin' in...

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before ?
There ain't no heroes here...no....no more

Hey hey hey
Oooh, play the game so nicely
Oh, check, its your move now
Yeah, we're standing in this jungle
Yeah, with serpents I have found

See you crawlin'...
See you crawlin' in...

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before ?
Have your heroes disappeared?

See you crawlin'....
See you crawlin' in....

So don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before ?
No there ain't no heroes here.......no no

Haven't I seen you here before ?
No there ain't no heroes here.

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them...
Haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?

Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them...

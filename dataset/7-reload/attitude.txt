"Attitude"

Suppose I say
I'm never satisfied
Suppose I say
You cut some root
To make the tree survive

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death

Ohhhh, I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

Suppose I say
The vultures smile at me
Suppose I say
I've sent them down
And they plan to pick you clean

And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Yeah gone again

Oooh, I hunger
Ooh I hunger
I eat

Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born Into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm bored to death

And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Gone again

Yeah I hunger
Oooh I hunger
I eat

Born Into Attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born Into Attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throwing all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

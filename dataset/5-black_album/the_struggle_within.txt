"The Struggle Within"

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

What the hell?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within

Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within

Struggle

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

What the hell?
What is it you think you're going to find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within

"Atlas, Rise!"

Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All Eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, reign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardize and ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world, and blame your maker
Wish â€˜em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

"Lords Of Summer"

Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster

Through your dreaming wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero

Excitation
Are you remembering the sound?
Recall the shaking of the ground?

Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned

Straight
Light passes through
Penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter

Illumination
Bright
Bathe in the volume and light
Reanimated by fire

Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground

Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned

Whoa... pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Whoa... pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
The lords of summer undenied, undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned l

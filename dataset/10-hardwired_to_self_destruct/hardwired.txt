"Hardwired"

In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

GO!

On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom design

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain

Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct

Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct

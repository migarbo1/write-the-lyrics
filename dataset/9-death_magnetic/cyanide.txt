"Cyanide"

Sleep and dream of this
Death angel’s kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty they say
Death, won’t you let me stay?

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
I’ve already died
You’re just the funeral
I’ve been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o’er me

Empty they say
Death, won’t you let me stay?

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
I’ve already died
You’re just the funeral
I’ve been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It’s peace at last, oh peace at last!

Empty they say
Death, won’t you let me stay?

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
I’ve already died
You’re just the funeral
I’ve been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It’s just the funeral
I’ve been waiting for

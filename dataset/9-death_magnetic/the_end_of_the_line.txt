"The End Of The Line"

Need...more and more
Tainted misery
Bleed...battle scars
Chemical affinity
Reign...legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain...rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke...asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch...kill the light
Incinerate celebrity
Reaper...butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline...redefine
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind...
You've reached the end of the line

Time...choke the clock
Steal another day
Die...faithfully
Narcissistic fade away
Twisted...jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker...chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind...
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell...
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind...
Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line

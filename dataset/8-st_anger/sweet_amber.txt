"Sweet Amber"

Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile

Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile

Using what I want
To get what you want

Using what I want
To get what you want

Using what I want
To get what you want

Using what I want
To get what you want

Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again

Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again

Oh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

Using what I want
To get what you want

Using what I want
To get what you want

Using what I want
To get what you want

Using what I want
To get what you want

Oh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in

She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in

Ooh Sweet Amber
Ooh Sweet Amber

How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

(It's never as sweet as it seems)

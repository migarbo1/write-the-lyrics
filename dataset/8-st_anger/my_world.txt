"My World"

The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead

It's my world now

Mama, why's it rainin' in my room
Cheer up boy clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world now
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today
Dancin' devils in angels way

It's my time now

Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world now
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

God it feels like it only rains on me

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Enough's enough

"Dirty Window"

I see my reflection in the window
It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgement on the world
This house is clean baby, this house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector
Projector, rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby, this house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector
Projector, rejector, infector, injector, defector, ejector, detector

I, I, I, I
Ha ha ha ha...

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector
Projector, rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector

I, I, I, I
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne, yeah

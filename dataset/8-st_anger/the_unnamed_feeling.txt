"The Unnamed Feeling"

Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before

Been here before
Been here before

Been here before couldn't say I liked it
But do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Oooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before

Been here before
Been here before

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive, It comes alive, It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Oooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
It takes me
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeayeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeayeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
Then I wait for this train
My toes are over the line
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, it takes me away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

"2 x 4"

I’m gonna make you, shake you, take you
I’m gonna be the one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Got some hell to pay, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement, pulls you under
Bite the bullet, well hard
Yeah, but I die harder, so go too far
Too far

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can’t hear you, talk to me
I can’t hear you, so talk to me
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, time to meet my lord
I can’t hear you, talk to two by four

I’m gonna make you, shake you, take you
I’m gonna be that one who breaks you
Put the screws to you, my way
Hey, come on and come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Friction, fusion, retribution
I can’t hear you, talk to me
I can’t hear you, come talk to me
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, time to meet my lord
I can’t hear you, talk to two by four

Talk to two by four
It don’t take no more

Friction, fusion, retribution
I’m gonna make you talk to me
I’m gonna trick you, so talk to me
I can’t hear you, are you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, you talking to me?
I can’t hear you, time to meet my lord
I can’t hear you, talk to two by four
She don’t take no more

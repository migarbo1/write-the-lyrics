"Wasting My Hate"

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you

Ain’t gonna waste my hate
Ain’t gonna waste my hate on you
I think I’ll keep it for myself

Ain’t gonna give no more
Ain’t got the time to help you score
I think it’s time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you’re worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell’s my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I’ll keep it for myself

"Cure"

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don’t fool again

He thinks the answer’s cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He’s been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
“I do believe”

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
“I do believe”
“I do believe”

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She’s been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
“I do believe”

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
“I do believe”
“Yeah, I do believe”

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone’s got to have the sickness
‘Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
‘Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone’s got to have the sickness
‘Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

“I do believe”

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
It’s got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyone’s got to have the sickness
‘Cause everyone seems to need the cure

“I do believe”
